# AquaTerrax

AquaTerrax is an environmental awareness web platform designed to address water and soil contamination issues through crowdsourced reporting and educational engagement. The platform empowers users to explore their municipalityâ€™s environmental status, report ecological issues, participate in games, and learn how to contribute to conservation efforts.

Deployed in 5 municipalities in Guanajuato, Mexico, the pilot implementation of AquaTerrax has helped reduce contamination risk by 40% in targeted areas.
